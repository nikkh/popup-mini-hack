![DevOps Projects Header](images/devops-projects-header.jpg)

## Challenge 1 - Create your first devops project
The aim of this challenge is to create a fully deployed sample application that is accessible from the internet, together with an Azure Repo containing your source code and a CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines.

If you plan to use the hints then choose to build your application using .NET Core and deploy it in WebApps for containers.

> Done: You can browse to the Application Home Page.

## Challenge 4 - Automatically create a work item when the build fails
The aim of this challenge is to configure Azure DevOps to automatically log a bug if your build fails.  You will need to aemd your code or some one of the unit tests to force the build to fail. Once you have created your bug, then fix it so your build is no longer broken.

> Done: Take a screenshot of the bug in Azure Boards

## Challenge 5 - Shift-left with SonarCloud
The aim of this challenge is to introduce [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/about) Code Analysis as a service to analyse you code and report on code quality as part of the build process.  This is slightly more involved, and requires a SonarCloud account.  You will need to register for a free account with a **Work or School Acount**.  

> Done: Take a screenshot of the code quality report in the SonarCloud portal.
